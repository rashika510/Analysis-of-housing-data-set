# Improving Accuracy of Real Estate Valuation using Stacked Regressor
Performed analysis on housing data set from Kaggle

# Goal of the project
Real Estate business is flourishing with each passing day making it imperative for an effective house prediction
model. This in turn will be beneficial to both the investors as well as the estate owners who can get effective prices without
depending on external third party agents or mere capitalization rates. Machine Learning can be leveraged for this
purpose. The project paper evaluates the algorithms which can be used to predict the house prices on the Boston dataset 
taken from Kaggle with 79 attributes like Living area, Condition at time of sale, Proximity to roads and rails, year built,
etc. taking into consideration all aspects from homes in Ames, Iowa. In order to predict House Price, which is the
dependent variable, regression algorithms under supervised learning are used. 

# Technologies and Concepts

Technologies: Python (Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy)

Concepts: Pre-processing, Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, XG Boost, Stacked Regressor

# Result
The project provides the most optimal solution with the Stacked Regressor, an ensemble model which in this case averages Multiple Linear regression, Random
Forest Regression and XGBoost regression algorithms ultimately giving a Root Mean Square value of 0.1047 and a high accuracy of 93.52.
